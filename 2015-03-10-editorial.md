Welcome to issue 22 of objc.io. This month, developers from some well-known companies in our community share with us how they work.

Brent Simmons starts off with a tour of how app development is done [at The Omni Group](/issues/22-scale/omni-group/). Next, the team at Artsy writes about the positive impact [working in the open](/issues/22-scale/artsy/) has had on the company's culture. Kyle Van Essen describes how Square has [scaled its engineering process](/issues/22-scale/square/) to a quickly growing team and increased quality requirements. Ashley Nelson-Hornstein walks us through the [code review process](/issues/22-scale/dropbox/) at Dropbox. Finally, Adam Ernst [introduces us to Components](/issues/22-scale/facebook/), a React-inspired library the News Feed team at Facebook developed to make the UI code easier to write and more maintainable.

Weâ€™d like to thank all our contributors. And like last month, [Ole Begemann](http://oleb.net) helped coordinate with the authors. Thanks Ole!

Best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, Florian, and Ole.
