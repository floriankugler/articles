## About Receipts

Receipts were introduced alongside the release of the Mac App Store, as part of the OS X 10.6.6 update. While iOS has always provided server-side receipts for in-app purchases, it was only with iOS 7 that iOS and OS X began to share the same receipt format.

A receipt is meant to be a trusted record of a purchase, along with any in-app purchases that the user has made — much like a paper receipt that you get when shopping in a store.

Here are some key points about receipts:

- A receipt is created and signed by Apple through the App Store.
- A receipt is issued for a specific version of an application and a specific device.
- A receipt is stored **locally** on the device.
- A receipt is issued **each time** an installation or an update occurs.
	- When an application is installed, a receipt that matches the application and the device is issued.
	- When an application is updated, a receipt that matches the new version of the application is issued.
- A receipt is issued **each time** a transaction occurs:
	- When an in-app purchase occurs, a receipt is issued so that it can be accessed to verify that purchase.
	- When previous transactions are restored, a receipt is issued so that it can be accessed to verify those purchases.


## About Validation

Verifying receipts is a mechanism that helps you to protect your revenue and enforce your business model directly in your application.

You may wonder why Apple hasn't provided a simple API to validate the receipt. For the sake of demonstration, imagine that such a method exists (for example, `[[NSBundle mainBundle] validateReceipt]`). An attacker would simply look for this selector inside the binary and patch the code to skip the call. Since every developer would use the same validation method, hacking would be too easy.

Instead, Apple made the choice to use standard cryptography and encoding techniques, and to provide some help — in the form of [documentation][apple-receipt-validation] and [WWDC sessions][apple-wwdc-2014-305] — for implementing your own receipt validation code. However, this is not an easy process, and it requires a good understanding of cryptography and of a variety of secure coding techniques.

Of course, there are several off-the-shelf implementations available (for example, [on GitHub][github-?-receipt-validation]), but they are often just reference implementations and suffer from the same problem outlined above if everybody uses them: it becomes very easy for attackers to crack the validation code. So it's important to develop a solution that is unique and secure enough to resist common attacks.

In the interest of full disclosure, I'm the author of [Receigen](http://receigen.etiemble.com), a Mac app used to generate secure and changing receipt validation code. In this article, we'll take a look at the mechanics and best practices of receipt validation.
        

## Anatomy of a Receipt

Let's take a technical look at the receipt file. Its structure looks like this:

![Receipt Structure](/images/issue-17/ReceiptStructure@2x.png "Receipt Structure")

A receipt file consist of a signed [PKCS #7][rfc-2315] container that embeds a [DER][wikipedia-x690-der]-encoded [ASN.1][itu-t-x690] payload, a certificate chain, and a digital signature.

- **The payload** is a set of attributes that contains the receipt information; each attribute contains a type, a version, and a value. Among the attribute values, you find the bundle identifier and the bundle version for which the receipt was issued.
- **The certificate chain** is the set of certificates required to properly verify the signature digest — the leaf certificate is the certificate that has been used to sign the payload.
- **The signature** is the encrypted digest of the payload. By checking this digest, you can verify that the payload has not been tampered with.


### The Container

The receipt container is a PKCS #7 envelope, which is signed by Apple with a dedicated certificate. The container's signature guarantees the authenticity and the integrity of the encapsulated payload.

To verify the signature, two checks are needed:

- The certificate chain is validated against the Apple Certificate Authority Root certificate — this is the **authenticity** check.
- A signature is computed using the certificate chain and compared to the one found in the container — this is the **integrity** check.


### The Payload

The ASN.1 payload is defined by the following structure:

```asn1
ReceiptModule DEFINITIONS ::=
BEGIN

ReceiptAttribute ::= SEQUENCE {
	type    INTEGER,
	version INTEGER,
	value   OCTET STRING
}

Payload ::= SET OF ReceiptAttribute

END
```

A receipt attribute has three fields:

- **The type field** identifies each attribute by its type. Apple has published a [list of public attributes][apple-receipt-validation-fields] that can be used to extract information from the receipt. You may also find unlisted attributes while parsing a receipt, but it's best to simply ignore them (mostly because they are reserved by Apple for future use).
- **The version field** is not used for now.
- **The value field** contains the data as an array of bytes (even if its name may suggest it, this is _**not**_ a string).

The payload is encoded using DER ([Distinguished Encoding Rules][wikipedia-x690-der]). This kind of encoding provides an unequivocal and compact result for ASN.1 structures. DER uses a pattern of [type-length-value][wikipedia-type-length-value] triplets and byte constants for each type tag.

To better illustrate the concept, here are some concrete examples of DER-encoded content applied to a receipt. The figure below shows how a receipt module is encoded:

- The first byte identifies an ASN.1 set.
- The three following bytes encode the length of the set's content.
- The contents of the set are the receipt attributes.

![ASN.1 DER - Receipt Module](/images/issue-17/ASN.1-DER-Receipt@2x.png "ASN.1 DER - Receipt Module")

The next figure shows how a receipt's attributes are encoded:

- The first byte identifies an ASN.1 sequence.
- The second byte encodes the length of the sequence's content.
- The content of the sequence is:
    - The attribute's type encoded as an ASN.1 INTEGER (the first byte identifies an ASN.1 INTEGER, the second byte encodes its length, and the third byte contains the value).
    - The attribute's version encoded as an ASN.1 INTEGER (the first byte identifies an ASN.1 INTEGER, the second byte encodes its length, and the third byte contains the value).
    - The attribute's value encoded as an ASN.1 OCTET-STRING (the first byte identifies an ASN.1 OCTET-STRING, the second byte encodes its length, and the remaining bytes contain the data).

![ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute](/images/issue-17/ASN.1-DER-Attribute-OCTETSTRING@2x.png "ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute")

By using an ASN.1 OCTET-STRING for the attribute's value, it is very easy to embed various values like UTF-8 strings, ASCII strings, or numbers. The attribute's value can also contain a receipt module in the case of in-app purchases. Some examples are shown in the figures below:

![ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an integer](/images/issue-17/ASN.1-DER-Attribute-INTEGER@2x.png "ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an integer")

![ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an IA5 string](/images/issue-17/ASN.1-DER-Attribute-IA5STRING@2x.png "ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an IA5 string")

![ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an UTF-8 string](/images/issue-17/ASN.1-DER-Attribute-UTF8STRING@2x.png "ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an UTF-8 string")

![ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an In-App purchase set string](/images/issue-17/ASN.1-DER-Attribute-SET@2x.png "ASN.1 DER - Receipt's attribute containing an In-App purchase set")


## Validating the Receipt

The steps to validate a receipt are as follows:

- Locate the receipt. If no receipt is found, then the validation fails.
- Verify the receipt authenticity and integrity. The receipt must be properly signed by Apple and must not be tampered with.
- Parse the receipt to extract attributes such as the bundle identifier, the bundle version, etc.
- Verify that the bundle identifier found inside the receipt matches the bundle identifier of the application. Do the same for the bundle version.
- Compute the hash of the GUID of the device. The computed hash is based on device-specific information.
- Check the expiration date of the receipt if the Volume Purchase Program is used.

**NOTE:** The following sections describe how to perform the various steps of the validation.
The code snippets are meant to illustrate each step; do not consider them the only solutions.


### Locating the Receipt

The location of the receipt differs between OS X and iOS, as shown in the following figure:

![Receipt Locations](/images/issue-17/ReceiptLocation@2x.png "Receipt Locations")

On OS X, the receipt file is located inside the application bundle, under the `Contents/_MASReceipt` folder. On iOS, the receipt file is located in the application's data sandbox, under the `StoreKit` folder.

Once located, you must ensure that the receipt is present: If the receipt exists at the correct place, it can be loaded.
If the receipt does not exist, this is considered a validation failure.

On OS X 10.7 and later or iOS 7 and later, the code is straightforward:

```objc
// OS X 10.7 and later / iOS 7 and later
NSBundle *mainBundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];
NSURL *receiptURL = [mainBundle appStoreReceiptURL];
NSError *receiptError;
BOOL isPresent = [receiptURL checkResourceIsReachableAndReturnError:&receiptError];
if (!isPresent) {
    // Validation fails
}
```

But if you target OS X 10.6, the `appStoreReceiptURL` selector is not available, and you have to manually build the URL to the receipt:

```objc
// OS X 10.6 and later
NSBundle *mainBundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];
NSURL *bundleURL = [mainBundle bundleURL];
NSURL *receiptURL = [bundleURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt"];
NSError *receiptError;
BOOL isPresent = [receiptURL checkResourceIsReachableAndReturnError:&receiptError];
if (!isPresent) {
	// Validation fails
}
```


### Loading the Receipt

Loading the receipt is pretty straightforward. Here is the code to load and parse the PKCS #7 envelope with [OpenSSL][openssl]:

```objc
// Load the receipt file
NSData *receiptData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:receiptURL];

// Create a memory buffer to extract the PKCS #7 container
BIO *receiptBIO = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
BIO_write(receiptBIO, [receiptData bytes], (int) [receiptData length]);
PKCS7 *receiptPKCS7 = d2i_PKCS7_bio(receiptBIO, NULL);
if (!receiptPKCS7) {
    // Validation fails
}

// Check that the container has a signature
if (!PKCS7_type_is_signed(receiptPKCS7)) {
    // Validation fails
}

// Check that the signed container has actual data
if (!PKCS7_type_is_data(receiptPKCS7->d.sign->contents)) {
    // Validation fails
}
```

### Verifying the Receipt Signature

Once the receipt is loaded, the first thing to do is make sure that it is authentic and unaltered. Here is the code to check the PKCS #7 signature with [OpenSSL][openssl]:

```objc
// Load the Apple Root CA (downloaded from https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/)
NSURL *appleRootURL = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"AppleIncRootCertificate" withExtension:@"cer"];
NSData *appleRootData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:appleRootURL];
BIO *appleRootBIO = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
BIO_write(appleRootBIO, (const void *) [appleRootData bytes], (int) [appleRootData length]);
X509 *appleRootX509 = d2i_X509_bio(appleRootBIO, NULL);

// Create a certificate store
X509_STORE *store = X509_STORE_new();
X509_STORE_add_cert(store, appleRootX509);

// Be sure to load the digests before the verification
OpenSSL_add_all_digests();

// Check the signature
int result = PKCS7_verify(receiptPKCS7, NULL, store, NULL, NULL, 0);
if (result != 1) {
    // Validation fails
}
```

### Parsing the Receipt

Once the receipt envelope has been verified, it is time to parse the receipt's payload. Here's an example of how to decode the DER-encoded ASN.1 payload with [OpenSSL][openssl]:

```objc
// Get a pointer to the ASN.1 payload
ASN1_OCTET_STRING *octets = receiptPKCS7->d.sign->contents->d.data;
const unsigned char *ptr = octets->data;
const unsigned char *end = ptr + octets->length;
const unsigned char *str_ptr;

int type = 0, str_type = 0;
int xclass = 0, str_xclass = 0;
long length = 0, str_length = 0;

// Store for the receipt information
NSString *bundleIdString = nil;
NSString *bundleVersionString = nil;
NSData *bundleIdData = nil;
NSData *hashData = nil;
NSData *opaqueData = nil;
NSDate *expirationDate = nil;

// Date formatter to handle RFC 3339 dates in GMT time zone
NSDateFormatter *formatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[formatter setDateFormat:@"yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss'Z'"];
[formatter setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneForSecondsFromGMT:0]];

// Decode payload (a SET is expected)
ASN1_get_object(&ptr, &length, &type, &xclass, end - ptr);
if (type != V_ASN1_SET) {
    // Validation fails
}

while (ptr < end) {
    ASN1_INTEGER *integer;
    
    // Parse the attribute sequence (a SEQUENCE is expected)
    ASN1_get_object(&ptr, &length, &type, &xclass, end - ptr);
    if (type != V_ASN1_SEQUENCE) {
        // Validation fails
    }
    
    const unsigned char *seq_end = ptr + length;
    long attr_type = 0;
    long attr_version = 0;
    
    // Parse the attribute type (an INTEGER is expected)
    ASN1_get_object(&ptr, &length, &type, &xclass, end - ptr);
    if (type != V_ASN1_INTEGER) {
        // Validation fails
    }
    integer = c2i_ASN1_INTEGER(NULL, &ptr, length);
    attr_type = ASN1_INTEGER_get(integer);
    ASN1_INTEGER_free(integer);
    
    // Parse the attribute version (an INTEGER is expected)
    ASN1_get_object(&ptr, &length, &type, &xclass, end - ptr);
    if (type != V_ASN1_INTEGER) {
        // Validation fails
    }
    integer = c2i_ASN1_INTEGER(NULL, &ptr, length);
    attr_version = ASN1_INTEGER_get(integer);
    ASN1_INTEGER_free(integer);
    
    // Check the attribute value (an OCTET STRING is expected)
    ASN1_get_object(&ptr, &length, &type, &xclass, end - ptr);
    if (type != V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING) {
        // Validation fails
    }
    
    switch (attr_type) {
        case 2:
            // Bundle identifier
            str_ptr = ptr;
            ASN1_get_object(&str_ptr, &str_length, &str_type, &str_xclass, seq_end - str_ptr);
            if (str_type == V_ASN1_UTF8STRING) {
                // We store both the decoded string and the raw data for later
                // The raw is data will be used when computing the GUID hash
                bundleIdString = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:str_ptr length:str_length encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
                bundleIdData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:(const void *)ptr length:length];
            }
            break;
            
        case 3:
            // Bundle version
            str_ptr = ptr;
            ASN1_get_object(&str_ptr, &str_length, &str_type, &str_xclass, seq_end - str_ptr);
            if (str_type == V_ASN1_UTF8STRING) {
                // We store the decoded string for later
                bundleVersionString = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:str_ptr length:str_length encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
            }
            break;
            
        case 4:
            // Opaque value
            opaqueData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:(const void *)ptr length:length];
            break;
            
        case 5:
            // Computed GUID (SHA-1 Hash)
            hashData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:(const void *)ptr length:length];
            break;
            
        case 21:
            // Expiration date
            str_ptr = ptr;
            ASN1_get_object(&str_ptr, &str_length, &str_type, &str_xclass, seq_end - str_ptr);
            if (str_type == V_ASN1_IA5STRING) {
                // The date is stored as a string that needs to be parsed
                NSString *dateString = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:str_ptr length:str_length encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
                expirationDate = [formatter dateFromString:dateString];
            }
            break;
            
            // You can parse more attributes...
            
        default:
            break;
    }
    
    // Move past the value
    ptr += length;
}

// Be sure that all information is present
if (bundleIdString == nil ||
    bundleVersionString == nil ||
    opaqueData == nil ||
    hashData == nil) {
    // Validation fails
}
```

### Verifying Receipt Information

The receipt contains the bundle identifier and the bundle version for which the receipt was issued. You need to make sure that both match the data of your application:

```objc
// Check the bundle identifier
if (![bundleIdString isEqualTo:@"io.objc.myapplication"]) {
    // Validation fails
}

// Check the bundle version
if (![bundleVersionString isEqualTo:@"1.0"]) {
    // Validation fails
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** When the receipt is issued, the bundle version is taken from the `Info.plist` file:

- On OS X, the version comes from the `CFBundleShortVersionString` value.
- On iOS, the version comes from the `CFBundleVersion` value.

You should be careful when setting these values, as they will be picked up when a receipt is issued.

### Computing the GUID Hash

When the receipt is issued, three values are used to generate a SHA-1 hash: the device GUID (only available on the device), an opaque value (the type 4 attribute), and the bundle identifier (the type 2 attribute). A SHA-1 hash is computed on the concatenation of these three values and stored into the receipt (type 5 attribute).

During the validation, the same computation must be done. If the resulting hash matches, then the receipt is valid.
The figure below describes the computation:

![GUID Computation](/images/issue-17/GUIDComputation@2x.png "GUID Computation")

In order to compute this hash, you need to retrieve the device GUID.

#### Device GUID (OS X)

On OS X, the device GUID is the [MAC][wikipedia-mac-address] address of the primary network card. A way to retrieve it is to use the [IOKit framework][apple-iokit]:

```objc
#import <IOKit/IOKitLib.h>

// Open a MACH port
mach_port_t master_port;
kern_return_t kernResult = IOMasterPort(MACH_PORT_NULL, &master_port);
if (kernResult != KERN_SUCCESS) {
    // Validation fails
}

// Create a search for primary interface
CFMutableDictionaryRef matching_dict = IOBSDNameMatching(master_port, 0, "en0");
if (!matching_dict) {
    // Validation fails
}

// Perform the search
io_iterator_t iterator;
kernResult = IOServiceGetMatchingServices(master_port, matching_dict, &iterator);
if (kernResult != KERN_SUCCESS) {
    // Validation fails
}

// Iterate over the result
CFDataRef guid_cf_data = nil;
io_object_t service, parent_service;
while((service = IOIteratorNext(iterator)) != 0) {
    kernResult = IORegistryEntryGetParentEntry(service, kIOServicePlane, &parent_service);
    if (kernResult == KERN_SUCCESS) {
        // Store the result
        if (guid_cf_data) CFRelease(guid_cf_data);
        guid_cf_data = (CFDataRef) IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty(parent_service, CFSTR("IOMACAddress"), NULL, 0);
        IOObjectRelease(parent_service);
    }
    IOObjectRelease(service);
    if (guid_cf_data) {
        break;
    }
}
IOObjectRelease(iterator);

NSData *guidData = [NSData dataWithData:(__bridge NSData *) guid_cf_data];
```

#### Device GUID (iOS)

On iOS, the device GUID is an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies the device, relative to the application's vendor:

```objc
UIDevice *device = [UIDevice currentDevice];
NSUUID *uuid = [device identifierForVendor];
uuid_t uuid;
[identifier getUUIDBytes:uuid];
NSData *guidData = [NSData dataWithBytes:(const void *)uuid length:16];
```
	
#### Hash Computation

Now that we have retrieved the device GUID, we can calculate the hash. The hash computation must be done using the ASN.1 attribute's raw values (i.e. the binary data of the OCTET-STRING), and not on the interpreted values. Here's an example to perform the SHA-1 hashing, and the comparison with [OpenSSL][openssl]:

```objc
unsigned char hash[20];

// Create a hashing context for computation
SHA_CTX ctx;
SHA1_Init(&ctx);
SHA1_Update(&ctx, [guidData bytes], (size_t) [guidData length]);
SHA1_Update(&ctx, [opaqueData bytes], (size_t) [opaqueData length]);
SHA1_Update(&ctx, [bundleIdData bytes], (size_t) [bundleIdData length]);
SHA1_Final(hash, &ctx);

// Do the comparison
NSData *computedHashData = [NSData dataWithBytes:hash length:20];
if (![computedHashData isEqualToData:hashData]) {
    // Validation fails
}
```


### Volume Purchase Program

If your app supports the Volume Purchase Program, another check is needed: the receipt’s expiration date. This date can be found in the type 21 attribute:

```objc
// If an expiration date is present, check it
if (expirationDate) {
    NSDate *currentDate = [NSDate date];
    if ([expirationDate compare:currentDate] == NSOrderedAscending) {
        // Validation fails
    }
}
```


## Handling the Validation Result

So far, if all the checks are OK, then the validation passes. If any check fails, the receipt must be considered invalid. There are several ways to handle an invalid receipt, depending on the platform and the time when the validation is done.

### Handling on OS X

On OS X, a receipt validation **must** be performed at application startup, before the main method is called. If the receipt is invalid (missing, incorrect, or tampered with), the application **must** exit with code `173`. This particular code tells the system that the application needs to retrieve a receipt. Once the new receipt has been issued, the application is restarted.

Note that when the application exits with code `173`, an App Store credential dialog will be displayed to sign in. This requires an active Internet connection, so the receipt can be issued and retrieved.

You can also perform receipt validation during the lifetime of the application. It is up to you to decide how the application will handle an invalid receipt: ignore it, disable features, or crash in a bad way.

### Handling on iOS

On iOS, the receipt validation can be performed at any time. If the receipt is missing, you can trigger a receipt refresh request in order to tell the system that the application needs to retrieve a new receipt. Note that after triggering a receipt refresh, an App Store credential dialog will be displayed to sign in. This requires an active Internet connection, so the receipt can be issued and retrieved.

It is up to you to decide how the application will handle an invalid receipt: ignore it or disable features.


## Testing

When it comes to testing, the major hurdle is to retrieve a test receipt in the sandbox environment.

Apple is making a distinction between the production and the sandbox environment by looking at the certificate used to sign the application:

- If the application is signed with a developer certificate, then the receipt request will be directed to the sandbox environment.
- If the application is signed with an Apple certificate, then the receipt request will be directed to the production environment.

It is important to code sign your application with a valid developer certificate; otherwise, the `storeagent` daemon (the daemon responsible for communicating with the App Store) will not recognize your application as an App Store application.

### Configuring Test Users

In order to simulate real users in the sandbox environment, you have to define test users. The test users behave the same way as real users, except that nobody gets charged when they make a purchase.

Test users can be created and configured through [iTunes Connect][itunes-connect]. You can define as many test users you want. Each test user requires a valid email address that must not be a real iTunes account. If your email provider supports the `+` sign in email addresses, you can use email aliases for the test accounts: foo+us@objc.io, foo+uk@objc.io, and foo+fr@objc.io emails will be sent to foo@objc.io.

### Testing on OS X

To test receipt validation on OS X, go through the following steps:

- Launch the application from the Finder. _Do **not** launch it from Xcode_, otherwise the `launchd` daemon cannot trigger the receipt retrieval.
- The missing receipt should make the application exit with code `173`. This will trigger the request for a valid receipt. An App Store login window should appear; use the test account credentials to sign in and retrieve the test receipt.
- If the credentials are valid and the bundle information matches the one you entered, then a receipt is generated and installed in the application bundle. After the receipt is retrieved, the application is relaunched automatically.

Once a receipt has been retrieved, you can launch the application from Xcode to debug or fine-tune the receipt validation code.

### Testing on iOS

To test receipt validation on iOS, go through the following steps:

- Launch the application on a real device. _Do **not** launch it in the simulator_. The simulator lacks the API required to issue receipts.
- The missing receipt should make the application trigger a receipt refresh request. An App Store login window should appear; use the test account credentials to sign in and retrieve the test receipt.
- If the credentials are valid and the bundle information matches the one you entered, then a receipt is generated and installed in the application sandbox. After the receipt is retrieved, you can perform another validation to ensure that everything is OK.

Once a receipt has been retrieved, you can launch the application from Xcode to debug or fine-tune the receipt validation code.


## Security

The receipt validation code must be considered highly sensitive code. If it is bypassed or hacked, you lose the ability to check if the user has the right to use your application, or if he or she has paid for it. This is why it is important to protect the validation code against attackers.

**NOTE:** There are many ways of attacking an application, so don't try to be fully hacker-proof. The rule is simple: make the hack of your application as costly as possible.

### Kinds of Attacks

All attacks begin with an analysis of the target:

- **Static analysis** is performed on the binaries that compose your application. It uses tools like `strings`, `otool`, disassembler, etc.
- **Dynamic analysis** is performed by monitoring the behavior of the application at runtime, for example, by attaching a debugger and setting breakpoints on known functions.

Once the analysis is done, some common attacks can be performed against your application to bypass or hack the receipt validation code:

- **Receipt replacement** — if you fail to properly validate the receipt, an attacker can use a receipt from another application that appears to be legitimate.
- **Strings replacement** — if you fail to hide/obfuscate the strings involved in the validation (i.e. `en0`, `_MASReceipt`, bundle identifier, or bundle version), you give the attacker the ability to replace *your* strings with *his or her* strings.
- **Code bypass** — if your validation code uses well-known functions or patterns, an attacker can easily locate the place where the application validates the receipt and bypass it by modifying some assembly code.
- **Shared library swap** — if you are using an external shared library for cryptography (like OpenSSL), an attacker can replace *your* copy of OpenSSL with *his or her* copy and thus bypass anything that relies on the cryptographic functions.
- **Function override/injection** — this kind of attack consists of patching well-known functions (user or system ones) at runtime by prepending a shared library to the application's shared library path. The [mach_override][github-mach-override] project makes that dead simple.

### Secure Practices

While implementing receipt validation, there are some secure practices to follow. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

#### Dos

- **Validate several times** — validate the receipt at startup and periodically during the application lifetime. The more validation code you have, the more an attacker has to work.
- **Obfuscate strings** — never leave the strings used in validation in clear form, as this can help an attacker locate or hack the validation code. String obfuscation can use xor-ing, value shifting, bit masking, or anything else that makes the string human unreadable.
- **Obfuscate the result of receipt validation** — never leave the literal strings used in validation in clear form (i.e. `"en0"`, `"AppleCertificateRoot"`, etc.) as this can help an attacker locate or hack the validation code. In order to obfuscate strings, you can use apply algorithms like xor-ing, value shifting, bit masking, or anything else that makes the result appears as random bytes.
- **Harden the code flow** — use an [opaque predicate][wikipedia-opaque-predicate] (i.e. a condition only known at runtime) to make your validation code flow hard to follow. Opaque predicates are typically made of function call results which are not known at compile time. You can also use loops, goto statements, static variables, or any control flow structure where you'd usually not need one.
- **Use static libraries** — if you include third-party code, link it statically whenever it is possible; static code is harder to patch, and you do not depend on external code that can change.
- **Tamper-proof the sensitive functions** — make sure that sensitive functions have not been replaced or patched. As a function can have several behaviors based on its input arguments, make calls with invalid arguments; if the function does not return an error or the correct return code, then it may be have been replaced, patched, or tampered with.

#### Don'ts

- **Use Objective-C** — Objective-C carries a lot of runtime information that makes it vulnerable to symbol analysis/injection/replacement. If you still want to use Objective-C, obfuscate the selectors and the calls.
- **Use shared libraries for secure code** — a shared library can be swapped or patched.
- **Use separate code** — bury the validation code into your business logic to make it hard to locate and patch.
- **Factor receipt validation** — vary, duplicate, and multiply validation code implementations to avoid pattern detection.
- **Underestimate the determination of attackers** — with enough time and resources, an attacker will ultimately succeed in cracking your application. What you can do is make the process more painful and costly.
