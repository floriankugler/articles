Welcome to issue 23 of objc.io. This month is all about video.

Playing, recording, and editing video happens a lot on the iPhone. It is amazing that a pocket-sized device allows us to do all this, and much more.

When dealing with video, there are many aspects that need to be considered. Adriaan writes about [capturing video on iOS](/issues/23-video/capturing-video/), and shows us a couple of different pipelines for video capturing. Daniel and Chris write about applying [Core Image effects to live video](/issues/23-video/core-image-video/) from the camera or a static file. Finally, Carola and Felix write about [Video Toolbox](/issues/23-video/videotoolbox/), a low-level framework that's very powerful, but relatively unknown.

Best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
